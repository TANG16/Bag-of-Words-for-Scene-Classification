# Bag-of-Words-for-Scene-Classification
Implementation of scene classification system using Harris detector and Bag of words method.
## Introduction  
This project implements a scene classification system using traditional detector and descriptor approach, which is bag of visual words instead of Neural Networks. The classification system has been tested on SUN Image database consisting of 8 secene categories including campus, bedroom, etc. The current accuracy is 42.75% with Harris detector, chi-square distance methods.
